Embracing risk
 Manage, be open and learn
 Every release comes with risk
 Be prepared

Define Error Budget correctly
Capacity - Scale up and down based on your traffic and business
timings.
Introduce Rail concept

Service level objectives
 Decide as a team = SRE, DevOps, Product Owners



Eliminating toil
 If it doesn't need human decisions, automate it
 If it costs more to automate than to perform the task, leave it

Scenario - Business wants RFB reports so that can be done through runbook automation
and automated consolidated healthcheck lookups.

Scenario 2 - Weekly purging of logs and cleanup space manually was an issue. 

Monitoring distributed systems
 Reduce fatigue
 What broke, when and why
 Fix root causes to prevent repeats

Automation
 The move to self-healing systems
 Anything that doesn't need human decision or interaction
 When it doesn't exceed the error budget or the total time to fix manually

****Release engineering
 Consistent deployment
 Solid understanding of SCM, Testing, CI, Post deployment monitoring

-Parallel Build
-Status check after build
-changes in GIT is the the criteria to build in jenkins.
-Testing after the build and before promoting to Prod.


Simplicity
 "At the end of the day, our job is to keep agility and stability in balance"
 Smaller releases, easier measurements



Others:

Scenario:
Blameless PM - 
Issue: The orderbook DB went down due to planned maintenance activity.
What we did:
Resolution - Roolback of the patch was performed.
Detection - User reported that they were not able to view portfolio or Order Hist.
Multiple incidents were reported.
Action Items - 
1. Build proactive monitoring on DB failures to identify before the field communicates the issue.
2. Change Managment communication to the stakeholders in advance on the downtime and signoff.
3. Resiliency should be build to failover to backup DB to avoid any downtime.
Lessons Learned - 
Not to blame the DBA or Event coordinator but put in measures to improve the process
and reduce the communication gap between infra and app owners.
